# Module 3 Challenge - JavaScript Professional Portfolio

This repo is for module three's challenge assignment.

## Description

The challenge is an On-the-job ticket/feature request Challenge (begin with starter code that you need to modify). The goal is to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria they've selected. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I wrote. It is also the goal to have a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes. Passwords can include special characters.

The motivation behind this project was to learn how to utilize the JavaScript skills we have been learning. I built this project in order to hone my own skills in HTML, CSS, Git and especially JavaScript. The problem it solved is making random passwords for users based on criteria they choose. After completing this project, I have learned a plethora in all the previous coursework, in particular, JavaScript.

## User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```
